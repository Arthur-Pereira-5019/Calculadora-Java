WIP Project!<br/><br/>
EN/US This is a Java calculator project that I did to exercise my programming logic, my knowledge of the language and version control with git. It reuses some code from a old attempt to make the same calculator.<br/><br/>
Functionalities:<br/><br/>
-Allows calculation with multiple numbers while following (B)ODMAS rule;
-Visual menu which elements can be easily changed orders;
